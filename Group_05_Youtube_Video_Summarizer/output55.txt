 You and a group of strangers have been
gathered to design a just society. You don’t know your age or sex, your profession or natural talents,
how much wealth you have, or your religious
or philosophical beliefs. Rawls was confident these principles could
only be realized in a democracy. But he felt existing social structures
weren’t the right path forward. He believed free market philosophies
and welfare capitalism led to unjust accumulations
of wealth and power. So Rawls proposed a new kind of democracy. One where no person was considered
less valuable than another and all citizens could live
according to their own wills. So, let’s play out this
thought experiment. The first step in designing our society
is deciding how to distribute what Rawls called primary goods. These include the basic liberties,
opportunities, and wealth necessary for pursuing most goals. Citizens would also have equal political
liberties to vote and run for office. For example, greater profits
can incentivize innovation, productivity, and investment. Rawls knew fully adopting this approach
would require major changes for existing democracies. But he believed his principles
could at least inspire some immediate improvements. For example, Rawls advocated for limits
on campaign spending and political contributions to reduce the influence
of wealth on politics. Some philosophers have
critiqued Rawls’ work. For example, the special needs
of a person with disabilities might not be satisfied by the
standard distribution of primary goods. But since its publication, this thought experiment has inspired
some very real consequences.
